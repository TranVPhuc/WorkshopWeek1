This Terraform code sets up a web server on AWS EC2 with a basic Apache web server configuration. By running this configuration, Terraform will provision the resources and launch the server with the specified configuratio

  
* **resource "aws_instance" "web-server-instance"**: defines a resource of type aws_instance and assigns it the name web-server-instance. This name will be used to reference this specific server in your Terraform configuration.

* **ami = "ami-085925f297f89fce1"**: This line specifies the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to use for launching the server. You can find different AMIs in the AWS Marketplace or create your own custom AMI.
* **instance_type = "t2.micro"**: This line specifies the instance type that will be launched. In this case, it is **t2.micro**.
* **availability_zone = "us-east-1a"**: This line specifies the **Availability Zone (AZ)** where the instance will be launched.

* **network_interface { ... }**: This block defines the network interface for the server. Terraform seems to be referencing an existing resource named **aws_network_interface.web-server-nic**.

* user_data = <<-EOF ... EOF: This defines a set of commands to be executed on the server during the first boot. The script uses #!/bin/bash to perform the following actions:
+ sudo apt update -y: Updates the package list for the package manager.
+ sudo apt install apache2 -y:  Installs the Apache web server software.
+ sudo systemctl start apache2:  Starts the Apache web server service.
+ sudo bash -c 'echo your very first web server > /var/www/html/index.html': Creates a simple index.html file with the text "your very first web server" in the root document directory of the web server (/var/www/html).
* tags = { Name = "web-server" }: This line assigns a tag named "Name" with the value "web-server" to the server.
